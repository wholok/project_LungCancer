Lung cancer remains one of the most prevalent and
deadly forms of cancer worldwide, necessitating the development
of robust predictive models for early detection and diagnosis.
In this study, we enhance the capabilities of existing machine
learning frameworks by leveraging XGBoost and Multilayer
Perceptron (MLP) models, in conjunction with SHAP (Shapley
Additive exPlanations) values, to create a more interpretable and
accurate diagnostic tool. The "Survey Lung Cancer" dataset was
employed to train and validate the models, providing a compre-
hensive benchmark for evaluating performance. Our proposed
methodology not only surpasses previous results but also achieves
a remarkable accuracy of 98.39% with both XGBoost and MLP
models. Key performance metrics include a precision of 0.9836,
a perfect recall (sensitivity) of 1.0000, and an F1 score of 0.9917.
These metrics highlight the model’s ability to accurately identify
lung cancer cases with minimal false negatives, which is critical
in clinical settings. Furthermore, the integration of SHAP values
enables the generation of intuitive and informative infographics
that explain the contribution of each feature to the model’s
predictions. The results demonstrate that our approach not only
provides a significant improvement in predictive performance
but also enhances the interpretability of the model, making it a
valuable tool for clinicians in the early detection and diagnosis
of lung cancer
